# Impero-Anti-Cheat-Strings-Exposed
Impero Launcher / Anti-Cheat Strings Exposed with njRat backdoor injected in it.
A simple External Anti-Cheat for FiveM made in c# cracked and it contain njRat backdoor in it.
The guy who created it is just ashamed to insert a backdoor into an Anti-Cheat used by hundreds of people.
Here you can see the strings cracked from this Anti-Cheat because he used a trash protector (Bed Protector).



As You can see there is a string that say:

awebclient:
    text "UTF-16LE", "webclient",0
anjRat:
    text "UTF-16LE", "njRat",0

**That mean it request webclient function to download njRat backdoor and start it into the computer.**
